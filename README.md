# conlangtionary
A dictionary editor for creating a conlang (constructed language)

## Under development
Look, I know there's a ton of dictionaries for conlang-ing... but I wanted to make my own.

## Planned features

* Easily start with a basic English dictionary
* English to Conlang / Conlang to English lookups
* Define a Conlang aplphabet - with custom font, romanization, and IPA connections
* Wiki-type editing, links to related entries, easily create an entry that doesn't yet exist
* Easily use Conlang font files, assign font file glyph to Romanized Conlang alphabet letter definitions
